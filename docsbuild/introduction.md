# Introduction

## What is it?

**MkTechDocs** is an open framework for collating and transforming markdown. You can use it to manage complex technical documentation projects with dependencies, produce light documentation, or combine and transform existing Markdown files into a styled webpage or PDF document.

## Features

-   100% open source
-   No proprietary, hard-to-read, or hard-to-learn input formats or configuration syntaxes
-   Standardized to Markdown with Pandoc extensions, which is easy to learn and convertible
    into many other formats
-   Shallow learning curve
-   Builds CSS-styled HTML, PDF, Microsoft Word, and markdown documents
    from the same source documentation
-   Encourages modular document design
-   Flexible and extensible
-   Projects ideally suited for storing in git repositories, which means
    documentation work can be distributed like source code
-   Python and Groovy/Java hooks provide easy access to pre-existing
    code libraries
-   Jinja2 and Groovy template support is baked in for more complex documentation needs
	 	Pandodc templates can be customized on a per-project basis
-   Agile and continuous-integration friendly

## Can I see an example?

You're looking at one! Now, check out the source in the [`docsbuild`](https://github.com/att/MkTechDocs/tree/master/docsbuild) directory to see what a MkTechDocs project looks like. Start with [`master.md`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/att/MkTechDocs/master/docsbuild/master.md). That's the master document. Every MkTechDocs project has one.
